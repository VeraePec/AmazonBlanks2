# 🌍 Country Detection System - amazonsclearance.com

## Overview

The country detection system automatically detects a user's location when they visit amazonsclearance.com and switches the website to the appropriate language, currency, and regional settings. **ALL countries in your Country Selector are directly supported and automatically detected.**

## How It Works

### 1. **Automatic Detection on Page Load**
- When a user visits the website, the system automatically detects their country using multiple methods
- No user interaction required - happens in the background
- Detection occurs within 500ms of page load
- **Users from Denmark stay on Denmark version, users from Norway stay on Norway version, etc.**

### 2. **Detection Methods (in order of priority)**

#### **Method 1: IP Geolocation (Most Accurate)**
- Uses multiple IP geolocation services for reliability:
  - `ipinfo.io` (primary - most reliable, no rate limiting)
  - `api.ipgeolocation.io` (backup service)
  - `ipapi.co` (last resort - rate limited)
- **Direct detection for all Country Selector countries**
- Maps unsupported countries to closest supported region
- Caches results to avoid repeated API calls

#### **Method 2: Browser Locale Detection**
- Falls back to browser language settings if IP detection fails
- Maps language codes to appropriate countries
- Example: `fr-FR` → France, `de-DE` → Switzerland

#### **Method 3: Fallback**
- Defaults to UK (English) if no detection is possible

### 3. **Country Support System**

#### **Direct Support (Country Selector Countries)**
These countries are **directly detected and supported** - users stay on their regional version:

| Country Code | Flag | Language | Currency | Example |

| DK | 🇩🇰 | Dansk (Denmark) | 63.85 kr | Denmark users see Denmark version |
| NO | 🇳🇴 | Norsk (Norway) | 99 kr | Norway users see Norway version |
| CH | 🇨🇭 | Deutsch (Switzerland) | CHF | Switzerland users see Switzerland version |
| FR | 🇫🇷 | Français (France) | € | France users see France version |

| TR | 🇹🇷 | Türkçe (Turkey) | ₺ | Turkey users see Turkey version |
| ZA | 🇿🇦 | English (South Africa) | R | South Africa users see South Africa version |

#### **Mapped Support (European Countries)**
These countries are mapped to the closest supported region:

| Detected Country | Mapped To | Reason |
|------------------|------------|---------|
| DE, AT | 🇨🇭 Switzerland | German-speaking |
| IT | 🇨🇭 Switzerland | Italian-speaking |
| NL | 🇩🇰 Denmark | Close proximity |

## What Was Fixed

### **Issue 1: Limited Country Detection**
- **Problem**: Only non-UK countries were being detected and applied
- **Solution**: Now ALL countries in Country Selector are detected and applied, including UK

### **Issue 2: Wrong Country Mapping**
- **Problem**: Users from Denmark were being redirected to other regions
- **Solution**: Denmark users now stay on Denmark version, Norway users stay on Norway version, etc.

### **Issue 3: IP Geolocation Service Issues**
- **Problem**: Primary service was rate-limited, causing detection failures
- **Solution**: Reordered services, added better error handling

### **Issue 4: Poor User Feedback**
- **Problem**: Users didn't know when country detection occurred
- **Solution**: Added toast notifications, improved CountryDetectionNotification component

### **Issue 5: Mobile Device Issues**
- **Problem**: Country detection notification was hidden on mobile
- **Solution**: Made notification visible on all devices with responsive design
