          title: 'Gets my cats approval',
          content: 'Nice sturdy cat tree which was bought to replace one that eventually became wobbly with age. The old one was mainly used by only one of my four cats who claimed it even before I finished putting it together and she would let the other three know they weren\'t welcome when she was on it. So I made sure to assemble this one with her out of the room so the others could try it out first and it worked because she is happy to share it with the others. Just a little tip for anyone who has a similar problem. Plenty of room for four cats with several places to nap or just watch the comings and goings of the household. It easily holds the combined weight of 20kgs of all four cats without wobbling when they climb or jump on and off. I am useless at putting flat pack things together but I found assembling this cat tree easy and it came with clear instructions. The cats love using the tree and there\'s usually at least one of them on it at any time day and night and I love it because it\'s nice looking at a bargain price. A good buy.',

          content: 'As usual the numbers/letter were incorrect on the items. We just took a screenshot of the product on Amazon\'s site to provide a proper idea of what goes where. Once that was sorted it was fairly easy to put together. All the necessary screws are provided plus an allen key. Both cats have already been on it and seem to like it, although the best bit for them was noisily rolling around on the plastic bag (supervised ofc). The tree appears to be stable even with a cat or two jumping on and off it. The teddy bear fleece covering all the structures of the tree are lovely and soft, the colours are as pictured, however, other than the cactus and the border around the top level, the fleece is rather thin. This however doesn\'t detract from how nice it looks.',

          content: 'Our very large snowshoe cat always struggles to squeeze herself onto most cat trees + they wobble under her weight. This tree is very sturdy, no wobbling at all and she fits perfectly on every level. She immediately went to sleep on the highest section. This is the third cat tree we\'ve tried and by far the best! Worth every penny. We now have a very happy cat. Was very easy to put together.',

          title: 'My cat likes it but I think the design & build could be more cat friendly',
          content: 'Overall it\'s a pretty good product, was easy to put together and seems sturdy once built. My cat took to it very quickly and spends lots of time snoozing in the top bed. She even uses the sisal wrapped posts for her claws. But she has never used the little \'den\' compartment and has only recently used the bottom \'hammock\' part. My main gripe is that there is not much \'foothold\' space, and she often has to do a controlled fall to get off it. It could also be better padded, for safety. When she is playing, she often loses her footing or her balance, and when trying to catch herself, has hurt herself on the sharp edges, despite them being covered in fur fabric, (which is the only thing she can grip on to stop or slow a fall). She also has fallen out of the top bed whilst having a stretch or a roll. Poor baby! But she does like it, so I\'m generally happy.',
