          title: "Brilliant!",
          content: "Have been very pleased with my previous Sharks but they are very heavy and having developed back problems I was looking for something lighter and easier to manoeuvre. I wasn't expecting anything comparable but chose another Shark due to the long run time. I am so impressed! It's still heavier than some other models but not excessively so and it is just so easy to use. It feels robust, picks up brilliantly and copes with pet hair. The instructions are simple and clear, the battery life is excellent, it's easy to empty, comes apart easily to fit the tools and changes from carpet to hard floors without all the usual flaff of changing the settings. Wish I'd bought one sooner.",

          content: "Used it twice, very good quality and ease of use, can rotate easily. Satisfying performance and suction. I could put it in a very small place with the foldable arm. I have used heavier cordless vacuums and the weight is okay. When I opened the package, the pet attachment was missing. However I contacted the customer service and after having a 10 min conversation and mailing, they sent the attachment immediately. The next day the pet attachment arrived. Very good customer service. Thank you Shark. The battery might be short for bigger houses, and you might charge it before fully cleaning the house. But single charge is enough for me (2+1). Very easy to clean the tank.",

          title: "Great cordless cleaner",
          content: "At the risk of committing heresy, I bought this to replace my Henry vacuum cleaner. Yes, I know most people see Henry as the king of the cleaners (and it's true, his suction is unrivalled), but I was really fed up of trailing the hefty Henry and his cord around the house, frequently getting held up by him falling over / getting his cord stuck on something. So when this Shark came up on special offer and interest-free payments, I took the plunge. And I'm very glad that I did. I totally expected the suction to be inferior to Henry's (it is a cordless, after all), but there are so many advantages: • The battery life is more than adequate – I can easily clean my cottage on one charge. • The system for switching the different parts is simple and easy – done in seconds – as is the flexi option for cleaning under sofas, etc. • It's very easy to clean – the tank for the dust (which is admittedly quite small – I often have to empty it twice during a whole-house clean) is quick and surprisingly satisfying to empty, and when the cleaner gets blocked (which it does quite a lot, as we have four dogs!), it's really easy to unblock. • It's very manoeuvrable – the head swivels and has a useful light on it, and it can get into most nooks and crannies. I tend to carry the nozzle tool with me and just quickly stick it on for the hard-to-get places. • It has a boost function for extra suction when required (but this really drains the battery quickly). The only disadvantages that I've come across are that it does block easily (but perhaps that was because it was faced with a gargantuan task the first few times, as I hadn't been hoovering as much as I should have because of my fraught relationship with Henry) and that the 'hard floor' setting doesn't really cut the mustard – I use the carpet setting for all the floors. The main part of the cleaner is also quite heavy, and while this isn't a problem for normal vacuuming, if you want to remove things above shoulder height or clean curtains, it's only possible for a few minutes (for me anyway ... perhaps I might manage longer if I worked out). So although I wouldn't say I was in love with my Shark, I'd say we are definitely very good friends. And Henry is in the Cupboard of Shame.",

          title: "It's the best hoover I've ever had",
          content: "I don't know why I didn't buy this sooner! It's an absolute gem. It's so handy, so reliable and I can easily get this out 10 times a day. It has headlights, it's quick but thorough, it's so light to handle and I love it. It folds down, is quick to charge and best of all it has a boost pull right under the handle. The battery time is fantastic. I hoover my 3 bedroomed house with carpets and hard flooring with great ease, in no time at all and it doesn't run out. I even use the long attachment to do the ceiling edges and corners with plenty of power left. It takes about an hour to charge it back up. It folds down and is compact. It bends with ease to go under bedside cabinets and drawers at the click of a button. I have a heavy shark pet hoover which is virtually redundant now although I will use it to deep clean now and again because this little magical cordless does the job extremely well. In fact, I actually like hoovering with this as opposed to constantly putting it off because of the heavy wired shark pet I have. It's because of this, my house is a whole lot cleaner. There are 3 adults and a messy toddler living with me and this has been the best thing I've ever purchased. I recommend this at the highest level.",

I employ a cleaner as I'm disabled, yet even I can use this Vac it's so lightweight and really picks up everything, shocked at what it picked up and my house had already been hoovered with a very well known brand previously. My sister bought one the day after on my recommendation and she's equally impressed as I am. The price was totally amazing. Really really happy to recommend, you won't regret it.",
