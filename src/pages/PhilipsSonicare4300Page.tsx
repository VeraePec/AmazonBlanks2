          title: "Great toothbrush",
          content: "Fantastic toothbrush, teeth feel really clean after using it. I had an oral b one before and this is much better and less noisy. It has a timer which tells you when to switch areas of your mouth and stops after 2 minutes. The brush is oval shaped not round which I find easier. The only downside is the cost of replacement brush heads, quite expensive but there are alternatives available and will look into those. Would recommend this toothbrush.",

          title: "Great cleaning result and perfect battery life! Never going back to Oral-B!!!",
          content: "Used Oral-B for decades but their battery life is not the same as it once was. My first Oral-B lasted for ages but the next 3 declined rapidly and needed to charge them every second day in the end. So I took the risk and gave Philips Sonicare a chance (got the 4300 for £65). Well well well, what a dramatic change, not only is the cleaning result much better (feels like a dentist cleaning after every use) but also the battery life is amazing. I use mine twice daily (approx. 4-5 minutes each time) and only have to charge it once a months which is absolutely amazing. Yes, the replacement heads are a bit more expensive than Oral-B but I got 4 for £10 on offer, so that's not too bad. Got mine now for 12 months and still works perfectly. Used 5 heads so far. Only downside for me is that the timer stops after 2 minutes and I have to turn the toothbrush on again. Would prefer if it just keeps going but it is not the end of the world. The other minor issue is that once you need a new head the brush will keep reminding you for a while which is a bit annoying if you want to use the old one for a bit longer. But this will also stop after a while and is no deal breaker either. Also the travel case is useful and since the battery life is amazing, you can leave the charger at home if you go on holiday :) Cleaning results 10/10, Battery life 10/10, Handling and looks 10/10. Would recommend it to anyone!",

          title: "Dect toothbrush",
          content: "Likes: - battery life. First full charge lasted just over 3 weeks, much better than the 2 weeks advertised (used twice a day on max vibrate). This and price are probably the most important factor in buying for me - dual speed vibration option - price (much more keenly priced than all the unnecessary Bluetooth enabled and app-connected brushes) Dislikes: - colour. I went for the black one as it was approx £30 cheaper than white at the time. Of course I could have paid more if I was desperate - travel case. Looks, feels and is cheap/poor quality. Like others have said, it doesn't really hold anything firmly in place. Having said that I generally take a good old fashioned manual toothbrush when travelling - no usb charging capability. It needs the philips charger with the two pin plug. Overall, despite my minor dislikes, it is a good brush at a good price and I am happy",

          content: "Why did you choose this product over others?: Had bought an oral b replacement after my old sonicare toothbrush finally died however the battery life on that was terrible. I got a replacement and it was marginally better but nowhere near the Phillips. This one went on sale so I switched back to sonicare and won't be moving from them again. Great battery life and cleans really well. Comes with handy travel case for when going away.",
