          content: 'This was really well packed. All pieces fitted together well, a couple needed a little persuasion with a flat block of wood, just because they were a bit tight for me to push together. Easy to move into position, very sturdy once assembled, and lid fits well on top. Hopefully it will be watertight as all edges overlap and there are no holes anywhere. Perfect for regularly used tools on the patio, saving a trip to the garage, and keeping everything close at hand.',

Build quality feels good as I would expect from ketter and the lid opens and closes without catching. This Ketter storage box was great value for money and is currently on offer.',

          content: 'I recently bought this Keter City 113L outdoor storage box and I\'m really pleased with it so far. It fits perfectly on my small balcony and offers a decent amount of storage for its size. The grey wood panel effect looks stylish and modern, and I love that it\'s made from 96% recycled materials. It feels sturdy and has already stood up well to a bit of rain, with no signs of fading or damage.',
