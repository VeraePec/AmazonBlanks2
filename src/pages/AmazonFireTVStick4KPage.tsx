          content: "The quality of the 4K does not disappoint although you would need to have a tv that is compatible with such resolution as well as a tv that supports hdmi \"simplink\" or similar to use the volume control function and using Alexa to switch inputs of your tv (a function I have used quite a bit since getting it)! I got this new stick on prime day to replace my old generation that kept freezing and this one has fixed that issue with no buffering at all! There is a wide range of apps that you can get including Disney+, Netflix which can be easily switched to using the buttons on the remote making it nice and simple!",
