          title: "Effective Robust Easy to Use Jump Starter",
          content: "Although this is the smallest of the range of jump starter power packs (GB40 1000amps) I found it to be extremely effective. It a in a different league to the older style jump starters being compact, powerful and effective. It is very good value for money. I found it easy to charge with a phone type USB charge cable and it reached 100% within a couple of hours. I have only used it so far to jump start a car with a dead battery and it worked brilliantly. It has more than one use as a phone charger, flashlight etc. Small portable with a convenient storage bag this is excellent value for money.",

          title: "Worked fine with 2.0 litre petrol",
          content: "Please note: this review is based about 1 week of ownership, so does not related to long term sturdiness or performance. Bought this after surveying all the various options and although there are some cheaper, it seemed like this combined the right capacity, additional safety features and clear design for the purpose. (Some cheaper items look like re-purposed phone battery banks, so I was sceptical how good they would be). My car battery suffered a fairly deep discharge during first covid lockdown and although usable, has never really been the same since. It's a heavy duty stop-start battery on a 2.0 Litre petrol. It's had to be charged a couple of times after standing and failing to start the car, and latterly has been showing signs of draining and failing to start the car after just a few days sitting not being used. So, i bought this as a \"get of out jail\" - especially if I drive somewhere and then the car won't start to come home. I've already had to use it, and I'm pleased to say that after connecting it up, waiting about 20 seconds to go round and get in the car and start it, it started first time. It would be useful if it displayed voltage when attached, then you could assess just how discharged the car battery is, but that's a minor niggle. For example, I don't know if my battery was just under 11v and the car electronics were deliberately preventing it starting, or whether it was much lower. It's really simple to use and the cables, though short, reach fine from the + terminal of the car battery to the -ve post on the engine wall - without anything dangling into the engine bay at risk of getting caught up. I was also impressed with how quickly it charged up. After receipt, and although showing empty, it only took a few hours plugged into a regular 2amp USB socket on my wall to get it fully charged. Then after starting the car a few days later, I simply plugged it into the USB in the car itself while driving and by my destination, it was fully charged up again ready to be used. (A bit \"belt and braces\" on my part, as after one start, the device was still showing green for the amount of charge left in it) It actually feels fairly sturdy and easy to grip and hold without slipping (more than can be said for some power bank chargers). Obviously I'm not going to deliberately drop it to see if it smashes open or not :) but it seems perfectly fit for purpose. All in all, i'm very pleased with it and the extra piece of mind it gives until I replace my car battery.",

          content: "This jump starter feels very well-built and is incredibly easy to use. Even with my car battery completely dead, it started my 2.0L petrol engine without any issues. The operation is straightforward and intuitive, perfect even in stressful situations. It's not overkill for me because I also have a diesel vehicle (though I haven't tested it yet since its battery is still fine). Overall, a solid and reliable product that gives great peace of mind",

          title: "Brilliant device but short cables",
          content: "I bought this after quite a bit of research and I am very pleased with it. I used it to start my Hybrid Toyota Yaris and it provided the power instantly. Great. It also appears to be very strongly built and is easy to use. My only issue is that for Hybrid vehicle starting the positive connector attaches to a specific connector in a fuse box right at one side of the engine bay, and the negative attachment needs to go to the engine or other connected component. Even in the Yaris, the engine is very marginally too far away. I DID find a sopt (obvioulsy as it worked a treat) but the cables are designed o fit across a battery terminal and not across an engine bay. There aren't any NOCO extension leads either, so in my other car I guess I'll just have to extend the earth from the GB40 to the car via another charger cable clamped together. Hence 4 stars.",
