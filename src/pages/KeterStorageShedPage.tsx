        content: 'Once built, the storage unit appears nice and sturdy. Everything lines up during build and the lock device is a nice touch. You have two holes for locks. I haven\'t noticed any leaks of yet!! Cons, my product didn\'t come with instructions but it took me all of ten minutes to figure out construction and another 10mins to put together. I was informed later, instruction can found on utube!!. That aside, it looks good and all belonging are safe and dry.... so it\'s perfect.',

        content: 'Great product, easy to assemble, neat and tidy storage for garden stuff. The only criticism is that it does not have a simple lid stay, so you need to hold up the lid with one hand. So I will make one to hold the lid up as necessary.',
