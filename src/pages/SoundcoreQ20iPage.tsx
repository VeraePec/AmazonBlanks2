The headphones have noise cancellation and transparency mode so great for keeping noise out but also helping you hear the kids when you are listening to something. They are very comfortable on the head and ears and size perfectly. I find the app to be simple and easy to use. I highly recommend this product but make sure you get when discounted.",

          content: "These were a really great buy. I bought for gym, work meetings and gaming. The sound quality is very good, noise cancelling is one of the better ones I've tried in a while. I saw the battery life was good so I'll need to test but they came fully charged and according to other reviews, I can expect to not have to charge for a few days. I haven't used for gaming yet, but they fit very well, the cushion on the ears and head is very comfortable and they are relatively lightweight. I like the design (bought the black). Very happy with this purchase. The app connectivity was easy enough only 4* because it wouldn't initially connect to my phone.",

Not used on board yet but noise reduction around the house and garden has been good so far, cutting out sound of neighbouring lawn mowers and power tools etc. Will edit when I return form next flight to update on noise reduction in flight. Good price for the quality of build and sound.",
