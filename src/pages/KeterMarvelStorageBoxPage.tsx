Very easy to assemble, didn\'t really need the instructions, even forcthe first time. , .It\'s sturdy, functional and waterproof. I was surprised by the avaiable space. The latest takes 3 big tents plus camping stoves and accessories etc. Still a little room left. Great outdoor storage and the top makes a nice seat, subject to ones weight!',

          title: 'Practical box from a well known brand. Was missing a roller wheel, but rectified by support',
          content: 'This 270L box arrived flatpacked, in fact I was rather surpised how thin the packaging was. Upon opening, there\'s a number of plastic panels and various parts. Initially it felt flimbsy, but once you click all the parts into place it\'s relatively sturdy and should be good to store moderately weight objects. Will easily handle cushions, wellies, outdoor toys and even gardening tools. Things have survived the rain and not wet inside. This box will also work well inside a shed or a conservatory too if you wish. Do read instructions clearly, when building since getting it wrong, it\'s hard to unclip these. However it was relatively easy to build and took about 10 minutes when taking care. Priced at £38 at time of review, I think this was a good price for a branded item. However I must say it was missing one of the two roller wheels at the bottom which means my one cannot be rolled around easily. I was a bit surprised to find this since the packaging wasn\'t damaged and had no visible signed of being tampered with either. I\'ve contacted customer services and I\'ll see what they say. Will update this review accordingly... Update 12th June 2025: Providing a quick update on this. customer services asked for a the missing part number from the instructions, as well as the code for the item purchased and receipt. Once relevant details provided, a replacement part arrived within a few days. All working fine, and good to see that the customer services seem to be very helpful. I\'ve updated the review due to having a full product now.',

          title: 'Gorgeous storage box',
          content: 'Moved recently and I have a garden without a shed. I needed a storage box to fit all my garden/ outdoor odds and ends. I chose this box for a few reasons 1. The space & functionality. The space is quite generous. Enough to fit all of my garden bits as well as a couple of children\'s scooters !! 2. The price point. Comparing to other storage boxes the price was competitive compared to other boxes that were priced higher with worse reviews. 3. The look. It\'s a lovely modern looking box. It looks perfect for my garden. It keeps all my belongings tidy and clean. I\'m even thinking of have a cushion put on top (not recommended by the manufacturer but my two small humans can easily sit on top of this) 4. Quality. With a trusted brand like Keter you can\'t go wrong. I\'ve had so many compliments for this box. It looks lovely and it was SUPER easy to put together. It took me, a gal, only 10 minutes to snap together. Make sure you follow the instructions though. Each piece has a number on it so it\'s important to fit it in the way it\'s recommended. Otherwise you will find it to be a nightmare to unsnap the parts. As for the points mentioned above and the tidiness this box provides for my garden I would HIGHLY recommend. I\'m even thinking of buying a second one.',

          content: 'So I bought this when it was on offer at £38, so basing this review on that.. as in, brilliant value for money. It was so easy to put together - I expected at least a couple of screws - but it all just snapped firmly together. I built it by myself in less than ten minutes. It is solid and looks really good, far better than I expected. It\'s been outside for a month or so now, in torrential rain, storm force gales and everything else you get in a north east summer (!) and everything inside is bone dry. Will get another if price drops a bit again and highly recommend.',
