      title: "Really powerful little vacuum!",
      content: "I'm really surprised by how good this little vacuum is. Does it feel super high quality? Of course not, but it's decent, structurally sound and well built. It comes with two head attachments and three detail tools that all work well. It's easy to empty and easy to wash the filter; What really impressed me is the suction. It's so strong it partially lifts my carpet up. It's got more power than my two precious 'branded' vacuums. It's light enough to pull around but sturdy enough that it doesn't tip over. It holds quite a lot of dirt. The buttons for starting /stopping and cable pulling are both sturdy and easy to tap either way your foot. All in all, it's really good value for money!",

      content: "AMAZING My henry stopped sucking well and i refuse to buy anything too expensive as nothing seems to last anymore. I have had dysons, shark, vtech, henry and this amazon hoover is amazing. Pros: easy to put together, small, lightweight, very powerful suction, good attachments, price is so cheap, I am 5ft 9 and the extended handle is a good height and means i can use it standing up and not bent over. Cons: the cord length is small",

      title: "Incredibly powerful for the price",
      content: "I am so pleased with this vacuum. It's deceptively powerful and performs well over carpet and smooth surfaces. It comes with a suitable range of adapters to cover all areas of the home, and it is fantastically portable. I'm also pleased with how easy access to the filters is for cleaning. For <Â£50, I'm happy. It's not a premium purchase, but the performance still rivals competitors asking 4 x times the price. It doesn't come without a few caveats. The 2L capacity drum is acceptable but may require a few more trips to the bin. It is thankfully very easy to dispense the collected dust. I also find on a few occasions the base of the vacuum likes to top forward, especially when trying to vacuum a tight space or corner, but it's really not a significant issue. Great cord length. Lightweight. There's very little not to love about this compact but powerful vacuum.",

Pick up is better than our old Henry and is lighter for moving up and down stairs. Also found a great little demo on You Tube which helped us to put all the parts together making it quick and simple. Even if it doesnt last mega long for the price i wont complain!",
