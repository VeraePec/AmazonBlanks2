      question: "Are the shelves adjustable?",
      answer: "Yes, the shelves are height adjustable in 2.54cm increments and no tools are required to adjust them. You can easily customize the height of each shelf based on what you need to store. Simply clip together the two-part plastic sleeves around the posts at your desired height.",

      question: "How difficult is assembly?",

      question: "Can this be used outdoors or in damp environments?",
      answer: "The black version has a plastic coating that makes it more suitable for damp environments like garages, basements, or covered outdoor areas. However, we don't recommend using it in fully exposed outdoor conditions as it may eventually rust. The chrome version is not recommended for damp environments.",
